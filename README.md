# GitHub_Tutorials
Here we are going to learn GitHub basics
-------------
Introduction:
-------------
Here you will learn GitHub basics like. 
  a. What are Repositories, how to create and use them.
  b. What are Branches and how to start and manage new branch. 
  c. What are Commmits. How to make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits.
  d. What are Pull Requests? How to Open and merge a pull request.

-------------
Prerequisites:
--------------
a. You must have a GitHub account. Use the below link to create GitHub account:
https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github

--------------------------
Step1: Create Repository:
--------------------------
a. Think Repository as a Folder
b. It contains all related items such as files, images, videos, or even other folders.
c. It often includes README file which contains information about your project.
d. README files are written in Markdown, which is an easy-to-read, easy-to-write language for formatting plain text.
e. GitHub creates README file at the time of Repository creation time. 

----------------------------
Steps to create Repository:
----------------------------
a. In the upper-right corner of any page, select , then click New repository.
b. In the "Repository name" box, type the 'REPOSITORY NAME' 
C. In the "Description" box, type a short description. For example, type "This repository is for GitHub Tutorial."
d. Select whether your repository will be Public or Private.
e. Select Add a README file.
f. Click Create repository.

----------------------
Step2: Create Branch:
----------------------

a. Uses: Branching lets us to have different versions of repository at the same time.
b. By default, Every repository has one brance called main 
c. We can create additional branches off of the main in the repository.
d. Using branchning, we add new features to the project without changing the main source code. To reflect those new 
   changes in main source code, we need to merge our new features in the brach into the main source code.
e. Creating a branch means you are creating a copy or snapshot of the source code in the main branch.
f. If someone else is making changes to the main branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those changes.

--------------------------
Steps to create a branch:
--------------------------
1. Click the 'Code' tab of your hello-world repository.
2. Above the file list, click the dropdown menu that says main.
3. Type a branch name, say YOUR 'BRANCH_NAME' into the text box.

Now you have two branches, main and your 'BRANCH NAME'. Both these branches have same content.

Next add your changes in your 'BRANCH NAME' branch.


----------------------------------------
Step3: Make Changes and Commit changes:
----------------------------------------
a. After creating a new branch, this new branch contains a copy of the 'main' branch content. 
b. Now we add our changes, Then save ou change. Saved changes are called commits.
c. Each commit has associated commmit messages, which explains the description of changes. Commit messages capture the history of 
   your changes so that other ontributors can understand what youâ€™ve done and why.

-----------------------------------
Steps to make and commit changes:
-----------------------------------
a. Under your 'BRANCH NAME', click the README.md file.
B. To edit the file
C. In the editor, add your changes.
d. Click Commit changes.
e. In the "Commit changes" box, write a commit message that describes your changes.
f. Click Commit changes.

These changes will be made only to the README file on your 'BRANCH NAME' branch, so now this branch contains content that's different from main.
